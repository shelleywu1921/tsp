This is an ongoing project on the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), started on January, 2017. We are a team of three undergraduate students from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/): Quincy, Sally, and myself, under the supervision of [Dr. William Cook](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/). 

I will (maybe, if time permits) elaborates on the description of our problem. 

This site is mainly a documentation of my work.  If I say something terribly wrong here please do not 


By the way, it was my greatest honour to work with a dedicated and intelligent team like this. My teammates constantly impress and inspire me with their amazing ideas. None of the contents on this side is possible without the collaborative effort. 


Before diving into the details of our project, let me introduce the overview of the problem. The TSP is known to be NP-hard, which roughly means (please suggest to me if you have a better interpretation) that there may not be an algorithm that runs  *reasonably fast* for all instances of the problem. Sad face.  



The first part of the project focuses on the theoretical aspect of the problem.
