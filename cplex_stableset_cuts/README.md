The code here should be compatible with python3. If not let me know and I'll fix it.

It ran super slow when the number of candidate teeth with respect to the handle is large, say above 1000. So may want to consider adding a bound on the number of teeth. However, I doubt if this is a big concern for uk49, as the number of teeth with respect to the handle is usually small. 



Change from optimize to populate.
