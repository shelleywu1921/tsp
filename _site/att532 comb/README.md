# A closer look at the violated combs in att532
The folder `things_that_work` records the code that found in total 7 violated combs in 2 runs. Here we would like to look at some properties of the violated combs found. 

`att532_combk.txt`, for k = 1,...,7 records the 7 violated combs found. 

`verify.py` verifies that they are indeed violated. The files  produced are named `verify_att532_combk.txt`. Some properties of the combs are also included in the file.
