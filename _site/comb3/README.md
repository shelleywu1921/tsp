# Third Attempt to Find Violated Combs




## April 15
Currently using `handle_to_teeth3.py`. In this file, the domino graph `G` is created by `create_dom_graph2` in `domgraph4.py`. `create_dom_graph2` *DOES NOT* creat the edges between dominoes. It is essentially just a recording of the nodes. This speeded up the computation significantlly.  For example `att532_handle_to_teeth_4.txt` only took 10 minutes, where as if using handle_to_teeth2.py it would take hours.
